## **INTRODUCTION**

#### Airbnb, the world leader in accommodations of the “sharing economy”, allows you to find places to stay directly from individuals in thousands of cities around the world.

#### It allows you to rent apartments (or even entire houses) from people all over the world, almost everywhere in fact.


## **Location Wise Room Availability**

#### From the Availability of room plots ,we can conclude that **Manhattan** has more number of room availability compared to other locations.

```{r , warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
anb1 %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood_group) %>%
  summarise(count=availability_365 %>% sum) %>% 
  arrange(desc(neighbourhood_group)) %>%
  ungroup %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=neighbourhood_group %>% factor() %>% fct_reorder(count),
             y=count))+
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())+
  geom_col(fill="#06cc4b")+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_dodge(width = 1),
            vjust = -0.5, size = 3.0)+
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 25),
    axis.text  = element_text(size = 15),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom")+
  labs(x="Location",y="Room availability")->plt1
ggsave("location-wise room .jpg",plt1, height = 8, width = 10, units = "in")

```


``` {r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("location-wise room .jpg")

```


## **Average Price for Each Area**

#### The Plot Below shows the average price of each location , Here we can see more variation in average price of each location. Overall, it looks like **Manhattan** Location is slightly pricier than other locations.

```{r , warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
anb1 %>% 
    group_by(neighbourhood_group) %>%
    summarise(count=price%>% mean (no.rm=T) %>% round(2)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>%
    slice(1:5) %>% 
    arrange(desc(count)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=count,
      y=neighbourhood_group %>% factor() %>% fct_reorder(count)))+
    geom_col(position = position_dodge())+
    geom_col(fill="#F6972C")+
    coord_flip()+
    theme_minimal()+
    geom_text(aes(label = count), position = position_dodge(width = 1),
              vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5)+
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size = 15),
      axis.text  = element_text(size = 15),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
      legend.position = "bottom")+
    labs(title="Average price of each Location",x="Price",y="Location")->plt2
    ggsave("Average-price of area.jpg",plt2, height = 8, width = 10, units = "in")
```


``` {r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("Average-price of area.jpg")

```
 

## **Ranking by Room Type**

#### Below is the chart that shows the distributions of Different room types of each location with respect to reviews.
#### Entire Room/Apartment type is highest in number, of all the other room types, and **Manhattan** has the highest Entire Room/Apartment type. People in Queens and Bronx prefer private room compared to Entire Room/Apartment type, this is so intuitive. We can also infer that shared room reviews are way less compared to other room types. 


```{r , warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
 
 anb1 %>% 
    group_by(room_type,neighbourhood_group) %>% 
    summarise(count=c(number_of_reviews) %>% sum %>% round(2)) %>%
    arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
    mutate(count=count/1000)  %>% 
    mutate(room=room_type %>% factor() %>% fct_reorder(count)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x =neighbourhood_group,
               y=count,
               fill=room,
               ))+
      geom_col(position = position_dodge())+
      scale_fill_manual(values = c("#06cc4b", "#349ded","#F6972C"))+
      labs(title = "Room Type of Each Location",
          subtitle = "Based on Reviews",
         x = "Location",
         y = "Reviews",
         fill = "Room Type")+
      geom_text(aes(label = count %>% round(2)), position = position_dodge(width = 1),
                vjust = -0.5, size = 3)+
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(
        plot.title = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.text  = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.position = "bottom")->plt3
 ggsave("Room Type of Each Location.jpg",plt3, height = 8, width = 10, units = "in")
```

  
``` {r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("Room Type of Each Location.jpg")

```



##  **CORRELATION PLOT**

#### This correlation plot is representing the correlation matrix of the numeric variables in the dataset. We exclured 2 variables : “id” and “host_id” which are also determined as numeric variables but have no meaning in our analysis.

#### Through this correlation matrix, we found that the “availability_365” variable is most correlated with the variable “calculated_host_listings_count” (21%), and then with the variable “number_of_reviews” (17%). Howerver, the correlations are not very strong.
```{r , warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}

anb2<- select(anb1,-c(name,neighbourhood_group,neighbourhood,host_name,last_review,room_type,id,host_id,reviews_per_month))
    #select(anb1(),-c(name,neighbourhood_group,neighbourhood,host_name,last_review,room_type,latitude,longitude,reviews_per_month,id,host_id))
 
  
   airbnbcor<-cor(anb2)
  ggcorrplot(airbnbcor, hc.order = TRUE, type = "full",
             lab = TRUE)->plot4
  
   ggsave("corr.jpg",plot4, height = 8, width = 10, units = "in")
   
```

``` {r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}

 knitr::include_graphics("corr.jpg")
